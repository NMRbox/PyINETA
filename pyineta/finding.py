"""Functions for finding INETA networks.

This file contains functions used by PyINETA to construct networks in the processed spectra.
Includes the following functions:
	* findClosestPoints - Uses KDTree to find close points.
	* mergeLevels - Merge points found in different iterations of peak picking.
	* horzAlign - Find horizontally aligned points.
	* getPairs - Get pairs.
	* buildNetwork - Build network.
	* listPairs - List all pairs of points that are part of a network.

def findClosestPoints (Pts,Qry):
	"""Uses KDTree to find close points.
	
	This function uses KDTree for nearest neighbor lookup to merge close points identified in multiple iterations.

	Args:
		Pts (ndarray): A 2D array of points.
		Qry (ndarray): A 1D array with a single point.
	
	Returns:
		A tuple with the distance and index of the closest point in Pts to Qry.

def mergeLevels (Clist,levdist):
	"""Merge points found in different iterations of peak picking.

	This function is used to merge points found in multiple iterations of peak picking into a single array.
	Points that are closer to each other than a defined threshold are merged into a single point.

	Args:
		Clist (dict): A dict mapping the iteration number of peak picking to a list of cluster centers for points found in that iteration.
		levdist (float): Threshold for merging cluster centers from different iterations into a single point.
	
	Returns:
		ndarray : A 2D array of merged points.

def horzAlign (P,threshold1,threshold2,threshold3):
	"""Find horizontally aligned points.

	This function starts building the INETA networks by finding the horizontally aligned points, i.e. points with same double quantum ppm values as defined by the thresholds.
	To find these points, this function also filters points using basic INADEQUATE spectrum rules to only keeps points that satisfy these rules.

	Args:
		P (ndarray): A 2D array of final merged points.
		threshold1 (float): Threshold to split the merged points along the DQ axis.
		threshold2 (float): Threshold to check if the sum of 13C ppm values for two points equals their DQ ppm or not.
		threshold3 (float): Threshold to check of the 2 points are equidistant from the diagonal.

	Returns:
		A dict mapping horizontally aligned peaks to their indices.
