"""Functions for reading spectra and peak picking.

This file includes all the function definitions used for reading the NMR ft files and peak picking.
Includes the following functions:
    * readFt - Read ft files using nmrglue.
    * shifting - Shift the spectra as needed for proper referencing.
    * frange - Generate a range of floats.
    * pick - Peak picking function.

    Shift occurs with user provided units along the 13C axis and by double the units along DQ axis.
    The empty cells are zero filled to complete the output array.

        fullY (int): Length of the DQ ppm array (8192 for a typical INADEQUATE spectrum).
        direction (str): 'pos' indicates shifting the peaks towards a higher ppm value while 'neg' indicates shifting peaks towards a lower ppm value.
