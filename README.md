# pyINETA

pyINETA is a Python package for analyzing INADEQUATE NMR spectra.

pyINETA can perform basic tasks such as reading and referencing (using basic shifting) the INADEQUATE spectra and peak picking. It is designed to filter these picked peaks to identify networks of peaks (ideally) coming from the same compound which it then matches to a simulated INADEQUATE database of metabolites to identify metabolites present in the query INADEQUATE spectra.
